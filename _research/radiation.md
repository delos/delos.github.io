title: "Halo formation prior to the matter epoch"
excerpt: "If initial variations in the density of the universe are sufficiently extreme at small scales, dark matter halos can form prior to the matter-dominated epoch, which began at a time of about 52000 years. I found that while gravitationally bound structures cannot form where radiation dominates, convergent particle drift can cause localized regions to become matter dominated and form bound halos long before radiation globally gives way to matter. These haloes would be around *a trillion times more internally dense* than the halos that surround galaxies."
