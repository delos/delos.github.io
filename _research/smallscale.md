title: "Modeling the small-scale structure of the universe"
excerpt: "All cosmic structure grew out of initially minor variations in the density of the Universe. This structure manifests visibly as galaxies, but it is dominated by invisible *dark matter*. Dark matter clusters into gravitationally bound *halos* that represent the building blocks of structure. The problem of predicting a halo population from the precursor mass distribution is a longstanding one, but I am developing new ways to approach this problem. My approach begins with the first halos, following their evolution as they cluster to produce later generations of halos."
