The dark matter could be primordial black holes. These are independently uniformly distributed in the initial conditions, which makes random Poisson density variations. Additionally, the interparticle "collisional" dynamics affect structure formation.

## Collisional heating
N-body dynamics between the black holes dynamically heat them, making a component of *hot dark matter* that could suppress structure formation on galaxy scales.

This can even make black hole clusters dissolve completely.

## Relativistic heating
Black holes can also merge, often giving the merger remnant a gravitational-wave recoil kick.
