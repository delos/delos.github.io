title: "Gravitational detection of dark systems"
excerpt: "Dark matter systems much smaller than galaxies are devoid of stars and gas, so they are difficult to see.
However, their gravitational influence alone can perturb visible systems, such as the motions of stars.
This picture shows the excess density (color) and average velocity (arrows) of a system of stars due to the gravity of a passing dark matter system:

I am largely using analytic methods to connect the properties of a gravitationally perturbed system to the properties of its dark perturbers.
