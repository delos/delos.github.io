title: "Gravitational detection of dark systems"
excerpt: "Dark matter halos are known to surround galaxies, but the vast majority of halos are expected to be devoid of stars and gas, so they are difficult to detect. However, they can perturb the motions of stars, dynamically heating stellar systems and producing characteristic patterns in stellar positions and motions. I am using analytic methods to connect the statistical properties of a gravitationally perturbed stellar system to those of its dark perturbers.
