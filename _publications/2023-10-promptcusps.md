excerpt: 'In this work, I showed that a significant fraction of the initial peaks form prompt cusps that survive up to the present day, and I found that if the dark matter annihilates, these prompt cusps dominate the overall annihilation rate by about an order of magnitude.'

As the first dark matter objects gravitationally condense, a density cusp forms immediately at every initial density maximum. Numerical simulations and theoretical arguments suggest that these prompt cusps can survive until the present day. We show that if dark matter is a thermally produced weakly interacting massive particle, many thousands of prompt cusps with individual masses similar to that of the Earth may be present in every solar mass of dark matter. This radically alters predictions for the amount and spatial distribution of dark matter annihilation radiation. The annihilation rate is boosted by at least an order of magnitude compared to previous predictions, both in the cosmological average and within galaxy-scale halos. Moreover, the signal is predominantly boosted outside of the centers of galactic halos, so alternative targets become significantly more attractive for indirect-detection searches. For example, prompt cusps present new opportunities to test the dark matter interpretation of the Galactic Center $$\gamma$$-ray excess by searching for similar spectral signatures in the isotropic $$\gamma$$-ray background and large-scale cosmic structure.
