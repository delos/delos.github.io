I am a theoretical cosmologist specializing in the origins and growth of structure in the Universe.  Since September 2020, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching bei MÃ¼nchen, Germany. Previously, I received my B.S. in Physics and Mathematics with Highest Distinction from the University of Virginia in 2010, my M.A. in Physics from Stony Brook University in 2015, and my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

What are the origins of the cosmic structure that manifests today in the form of galaxies? What is the mysterious dark matter that comprises most of this structure?
My research seeks answers to these questions. I use a combination of numerical simulations and mathematical models to develop new ways to probe these mysteries using astronomical data. I am particularly interested in the dynamics of self-gravitating systems, and much of my research focuses on understanding how gravitationally bound dark matter halos evolve.
