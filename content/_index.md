I am a theoretical cosmologist specializing in the origins and growth of structure in the Universe.  I am a PhD student in my fourth year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously, I received my B.S. in Physics and Mathematics with Highest Distinction from the University of Virginia in 2010 and my M.A. in Physics from Stony Brook University in 2015.

What are the origins of the cosmic structure that manifests today in the form of galaxies? What is the mysterious dark matter that comprises most of this structure?
My research seeks answers to these questions. I use a combination of numerical simulations and mathematical models to develop new ways to probe these mysteries using astronomical data.
