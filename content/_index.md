I am a theoretical cosmologist specializing in the origins and growth of structure in the Universe.  I am in my fourth year in the Physics doctoral program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously, I received my B.S. in Physics and Mathematics with Highest Distinction from the University of Virginia in 2010 and my M.A. in Physics from Stony Brook University in 2015.

What are the origins of the cosmic structure that manifests today in the form of galaxies? What is the mysterious dark matter that comprises most of this structure?
My research probes these deep questions about our Universe.  Additionally, I am interested in the mathematical behavior of complex systems, which motivates my focus on the dynamics of self-gravitating many-bodied systems.
