title = "Past UNC Physics Qualifier Solutions"

Below are my solutions to a range of past UNC-Chapel Hill physics qualifying exam problems.  This is intended as a resource for other UNC-Chapel Hill physics graduate students.  Be warned that not all solutions are correct!  If you find something wrong, let me know and I'll make a note of it.  Also, I have no solutions to the astro problems, but all other missing solutions are noted.

## 2015 exam  
[2015 qualifying exam](/pdf/DWE_2015.pdf)  
[2015 solutions](/pdf/Sten_qual_2015_solutions.PDF)  
* SM-2: off by 3/5
* QMI-4: (c) is formally wrong:  I should have transformed to the j,m (total angular momentum) basis.  Result is the same by coincidence.

## 2014 exam  
[2014 qualifying exam](/pdf/DWE_2014.pdf)  
[2014 solutions](/pdf/Sten_qual_2014_solutions.PDF)  
* EMI-5: not sure if I have (c) right

## 2013 exam  
[2013 qualifying exam](/pdf/DWE_2013.pdf)  
[2013 solutions](/pdf/Sten_qual_2013_solutions.PDF)  
* CM-4: not sure about (d)
* EMI-4: missing
* QMII-3: numerical error (should be about -2.14 MeV) but otherwise correct.

## 2012 exam  
[2012 qualifying exam](/pdf/DWE_2012.pdf)  
[2012 solutions](/pdf/Sten_qual_2012_solutions.PDF)  
* CM-4: not sure about interpretation in (b)
* SM-5: not sure if my approach is remotely correct
* QMI-1: sign error in two of the eigenvalues

## 2011 exam  
[2011 qualifying exam](/pdf/DWE_2011.pdf)  
[2011 solutions](/pdf/Sten_qual_2011_solutions.PDF)  
* SM-3: my result differs by a factor of 2 in one term
* QMI-2: not sure if correct

## 2010 exam  
[2010 qualifying exam](/pdf/DWE_2010.pdf)  
[2010 solutions](/pdf/Sten_qual_2010_solutions.PDF)  
* QMI-5: not sure if vibrational levels are supposed to come in
* QMII-5: missing
* EMII missing (all)
