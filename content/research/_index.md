**Probing the early universe using dark matter minihalos**  
[[More detail]](early/)  
The first gravitationally bound objects in the Universe were small, potentially Solar System--scale dark matter *minihalos*. These objects are broadly expected to survive today, and their potentially observable characteristics represent a probe of the primordial mass distribution at otherwise inaccessibly small scales. Consequently, they represent a unique probe of the late stages of inflation and the early postinflationary period. I use *N*-body simulations and mathematical modeling to decipher the connection between minihalos today and primordial cosmology.

**Predicting populations of dark matter halos**  
[[More detail]](halos/)  
All cosmic structure grew out of initially minor variations in the density of the Universe. This structure manifests visibly as galaxies, but it is dominated by invisible *dark matter*. Dark matter clusters into gravitationally bound *halos* that represent the building blocks of structure. The problem of predicting a halo population from the precursor mass distribution is a longstanding one, but I am developing new ways to approach this problem. My approach begins with the first halos, following their evolution as they cluster to produce later generations of halos.
